Ideas:

Interface for typing things in so they aren't hardcoded!!
	Main Menu with 3 buttons: Start Quiz (grey if no words exist), Add New Words, Retire Old Words
	Add New Words takes you to a screen with 2 textboxes: one for the word, one for the phrase
		2 buttons: Add and Done
		Add is the default.
	Retire Old Words will store the previous week's words (or just delete them for now)
	Start Quiz opens the existing form

	The words need to be stored in a text/xml file or something...



Low priority:

Noises for right/wrong answers
	Fireworks for correct stuff would be nice

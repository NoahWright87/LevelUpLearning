# LevelUpLearning
Welcome to Level Up Learning!  This is a side project by [Noah Wright](https://github.com/NoahWright87) to help his kids (and anybody else's) with various learning activities.  Started years ago and revisited due to the at-home-learning debacle that came along with COVID-19, this is a work-in-progress that will be added onto over time.

**The end goal**: This will be a collection of learning activities and games that track your "experience" in various subjects so you can "level up" your school skills.  Eventually this will expand to be a variety of skills at various grade levels, available to be used by multiple kids.

## Current Features
### Users
You can create users.  This is very limited, but if you have multiple kids (like me) it means you can track their performance separately.

### Spelling Test
Currently, you can:
- Create lists of words, with an example sentence for each word
- Quiz yourself on any number of those lists at once
- Select difficulty.  Lower difficulties will give you hint letters and show blank spaces, the highest difficulty is like a traditional test and gives you no help.
- See (but not save ðŸ˜¢) your performance after the test


## Upcoming Features
There are 2 major focuses in the next update:
1) Progress will be saved and can be viewed later - otherwise how will you *level up*?
2) Speed up the creation of word lists.  Ideally, this will mean the ability to import/export lists of words - after which I will post lists of words online so they can used by other people - but at a minimum it should mean a quick-entry form where lists of words can be entered quickly.

Feel free to check out [this repo's project](https://github.com/NoahWright87/LevelUpLearning/projects/2) to see what else is being worked and what's planned down the road.
